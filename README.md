### Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible based on its characteristics. It's a Kaggle competition under the [Tabular Playground Series](https://kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e8) that provides the community with lightweight challenges that help practitioners sharpen their skills in different machine learning and data science aspects.
